This script is a wrapper around curl, a popular command line http client, that
will calculate the authentication parameters for the request.

To start, create an .s3curl file in your home directory.  This file will contain your
AWS Access Key Id and AWS Secret Access Key pairs.

For example:

%awsSecretAccessKeys = (
    # personal account
    personal => {
        id => '1ME55KNV6SBTR7EXG0R2',
        key => 'zyMrlZUKeG9UcYpwzlPko/+Ciu0K2co0duRM3fhi',
    },

   # corporate account
   company => {
        id => '1ATXQ3HHA59CYF1CVS02',
        key => 'WQY4SrSS95pJUT95V6zWea01gBKBCL6PI0cdxeH8',
    },
);

After creating the .s3curl file, you can try the following commands using s3curl


To get an object, you would run:

./s3curl.pl --id=[friendly-name] -- http://s3.amazonaws.com/[bucket-name]/[key-name]

If you just want to see the object's metadata, run:

./s3curl.pl --id=[friendly=name] --head -- http://s3.amazonaws.com/[bucket-name]/[key-name]


The arguments after the '--' are passed through to curl, so you could put any
curl specific options there, and then the url you are trying to get.

To put an object, run:

./s3curl.pl --id=[friendly-name] --put=<file-name> -- http://s3.amazonaws.com/[bucket-name]/[key-name]

To delete an object:

./s3curl.pl --id=[friendly-name] --delete -- http://s3.amazonaws.com/[bucket-name]/[key-name]


To list a bucket:

./s3curl.pl --id=[friendly-name] -- http://s3.amazonaws.com/[bucket-name]

To create a bucket:

./s3curl.pl --id=[friendly-name] --createBucket -- http://s3.amazonaws.com/[bucket-name]

To create a bucket with a location constraint EU:

./s3curl.pl --id=[friendly-name] --createBucket=EU -- http://s3.amazonaws.com/[bucket-name]

To delete a bucket:

./s3curl.pl --id=[friendly-name] --delete -- http://s3.amazonaws.com/[bucket-name]


SECURITY CONSIDERATION:

On a shared system, it is dangerous to specify your AWS Secret Access Key on
the command line, as any other user on the machine can view your command line.
Therefore we strongly advocate the use of .s3curl file to store and manage your
keys.
